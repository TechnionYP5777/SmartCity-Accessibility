## The Project

### Introduction 
This project is designed to help people with disabilities search for and navigate to accessible locations.

The main features we will focus on are :

1.	A social network for ranking and reviewing of different street sections and buildings. User rating will effect whether a location is viewed as accessible or inaccessible.

2.	Searching for locations in accordance to queries that can involve travel time, accessibility rating, etc.

3.	Navigation through accessible paths only.



### Theoretical Background
People with movement disabilities find it difficult to move freely in the public domain because the street and the buildings of the city are not adapted to their needs. Our goal is to create software that will ease that difficulty.
The application will allow the user to navigate in the city effectively taking into account the limitations of his movement. i.e. the user can find accessible paths in the city and find accessible facilities such as restaurants, cinemas, etc.


## Software Implementation

### Frameworks

- Google Maps Java Api
- RxJava

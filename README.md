# SmartCity-Accessibility

## The Project

### Introduction 
This project is designed to help people with disabilities search for and navigate to accessible locations.

The main features we will focus on are :

1.	A social network for ranking and reviewing of different street sections and buildings. User rating will effect whether a location is viewed as accessible or inaccessible.

2.	Searching for locations in accordance to queries that can involve travel time, accessibility rating, etc.

3.	Navigation through accessible paths only.



### Theoretical Background
People with movement disabilities find it difficult to move freely in the public domain because the street and the buildings of the city are not adapted to their needs. Our goal is to create software that will ease that difficulty.
The application will allow the user to navigate in the city effectively taking into account the limitations of his movement. i.e. the user can find accessible paths in the city and find accessible facilities such as restaurants, cinemas, etc.



### Programming Environment

- Eclipse Neon Java
- Linux
- Github
- JxMaps
- Parse4j
- MapQuest



**Basic System Functionalities**

Will be detailed in the final report.


### Software Implementation

Modules :

1.	GUI

2.	Database 

3.	Social network - reviews and users

4.	Navigation algorithm

5.	Search queries

A full class diagram can be found in the wiki https://github.com/TechnionYP5777/SmartCity-Accessibility/wiki/Class-Diagram


### User Interface

The interface availabe to the user will consist of the following :

1.	Map of the city.

2.	 A search bar that will allow him to find accessible facilities in the city.

3.	 Option to mark locations on the map and search for accessible paths.

4.	 Option to review locations on the map.

5.	 Option to mark like/dislike the reviews of others users.

## The Code 
### Instructions 
To get started with the code, clone the project to your machine and open in eclipse as a maven project.
After that you will need to follow the instructions in this wiki https://github.com/TechnionYP5777/SmartCity-Accessibility/wiki/JxMaps-dependency to set up the JxMaps dependency correctly.
